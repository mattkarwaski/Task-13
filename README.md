# Task-13
Hello Vlad!
This is my work so far.
Page is working and change theme works, but...
I didnt make addEventListener. Instead ive just added  onclick into html (yeah i know bad idea). Could you point me in right direction how can addEventListener be done in here.
Second issue i got in this task is @import /.theme-dark. How can i link it or write code so that theme can be read without addind that theme into main style.scss (all styles wich ive
done, i know bad idea).
Beside that everything works but im not happy how it looks like.
Have a nice sunday :)
PS:
Was a pleasure listening to your lessons. Hope we can meet again. Someday (or in advance level lessons in IT-Academy :]). Take care.
